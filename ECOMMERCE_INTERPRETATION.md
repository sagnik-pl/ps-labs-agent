# E-commerce Data Interpretation System

## Overview

The system now has a **specialized e-commerce data interpretation layer** that transforms raw data into actionable business insights with deep domain knowledge.

## Architecture

### New Workflow

```
START → Planner → Router → Data Agent → Validator
                              ↑          ↓
                              └─ retry ─┘
                                         ↓
                            Data Interpreter (E-commerce Brain)
                                         ↓
                         Interpretation Validator
                              ↑          ↓
                    retry ────┘    valid → Final Response → END
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **Data Interpreter Agent** (The Brain)
- **Purpose**: Transform raw data into e-commerce insights
- **Knowledge**: Deep e-commerce expertise built-in
- **Output**: Structured, actionable recommendations

#### 2. **Interpretation Validator**
- **Purpose**: Quality control for interpretations
- **Checks**: Context, benchmarks, actionability, clarity
- **Action**: Retry if quality < 80/100 (max 2 retries)

#### 3. **E-commerce Knowledge Bases**
- `ecommerce_fundamentals.md` - KPIs, metrics, benchmarks
- `social_media_marketing.md` - Instagram, Facebook best practices
- `data_interpretation_principles.md` - How to interpret data well

## What Makes It Special

### Before (Simple Interpretation)
```
Query: "Show my Instagram performance"
Response: "You have 1000 followers and 50 likes on your last post."
```

### After (E-commerce Interpretation)
```
Query: "Show my Instagram performance"

Response:
📊 Key Findings
- Engagement rate: 2.5% (average for retail, benchmark: 1-3%)
- Reach rate: 15% (good, benchmark: 10-20%)

📈 Performance Analysis
Your engagement is performing at industry average but has room
for improvement...

💡 Insights & Patterns
Reels get 3x more engagement than posts. Your posting frequency
dropped 40% last month which correlates with the reach decline...

🎯 Recommendations
1. Increase Reel production from 2/week to 4/week
   Expected impact: +25% engagement rate
2. Post during peak times (7-9pm)
   Expected impact: +15% reach
...
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Deep E-commerce Context**

Every interpretation includes:
- ✅ Industry benchmarks
- ✅ What's good/average/excellent
- ✅ Comparison to standards
- ✅ Business impact quantification

### 2. **Actionable Recommendations**

Not just "what" but "so what":
- Specific next steps
- Expected impact
- Prioritized by importance
- Realistic and achievable

### 3. **Quality Validation Loop**

If interpretation is weak:
1. Validator identifies issues
2. Provides specific feedback
3. Interpreter retries with feedback
4. Validates again (up to 2 retries)

### 4. **Structured Output**

Every response has:
- 📊 **Key Findings** - Most important insights
- 📈 **Performance Analysis** - Detailed breakdown with benchmarks
- 💡 **Insights & Patterns** - What's driving the numbers
- 🎯 **Recommendations** - Prioritized action items
- ⚠️ **Risks & Considerations** - What to watch out for

## How to Improve the Interpretation Brain

### Option 1: Add More E-commerce Knowledge

```bash
# Add new knowledge about email marketing
vim prompts/knowledge/email_marketing.md

# Add to data interpreter prompt
vim prompts/agents/data_interpreter.yaml
# Add: - email_marketing to knowledge_bases
```

### Option 2: Update Existing Knowledge

```bash
# Update Instagram benchmarks
vim prompts/knowledge/social_media_marketing.md

# All interpretations automatically use new benchmarks!
```

### Option 3: Version the Interpreter

```python
from prompts.prompt_manager import prompt_manager

# Save improved version
prompt_manager.save_agent_prompt(
    "data_interpreter",
    improved_prompt,
    version="v2",
    metadata={
        "changes": "Added TikTok e-commerce insights",
        "improved_benchmarks": "Updated for 2025"
    }
)
```
