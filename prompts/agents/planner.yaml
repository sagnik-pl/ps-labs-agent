  ## User Context

  {profile_context}

  ## Task

  User Query: {query}

  ## Conversation Context

  {context}

  ### IMPORTANT: Understanding Temporal References in Context

  When analyzing the user query, pay careful attention to temporal references that relate to previous conversation:

  - **"before that"** / **"prior to that"** → Refers to the time period BEFORE the one mentioned in the previous query
    Example: If previous query was "last 30 days" and current is "what about 30 days before that?", interpret as days 31-60

  - **"compared to"** / **"vs"** → User wants comparison between current period and a different period
    Example: "How does this compare to the previous month?" means compare the period discussed vs one month earlier

  - **"the change from"** → User is asking about delta/difference between two periods
    Example: "What was the change from last month?" when previous query was about "this month"

  - **"that time"** / **"back then"** → Refers to the specific time period discussed in previous message

  **How to use context:**
  1. Read the conversation context carefully to understand what time periods were previously discussed
  2. If user uses relative temporal references, resolve them against the previous context
  3. Extract the actual date ranges or periods from previous assistant responses if needed
  4. When in doubt about ambiguous time references, look for clues in the conversation history

  Create an execution plan. Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
  {{
      "steps": [
          {{
              "step_number": 1,
              "agent": "agent_name",
              "action": "description of what this step does",
              "dependencies": [],
              "expected_output": "what this step should produce"
          }}
      ],
      "requires_multiple_agents": false,
      "estimated_complexity": "low|medium|high",
      "reasoning": "brief explanation of the plan"
  }}

  IMPORTANT:
  - Break complex queries into logical steps
  - Consider dependencies between steps
  - Only use agents that are currently available
  - For unavailable agents, note in reasoning that feature is coming soon
