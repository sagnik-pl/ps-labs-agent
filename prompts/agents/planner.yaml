  Create an execution plan. Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
  {{
      "steps": [
          {{
              "step_number": 1,
              "agent": "agent_name",
              "action": "description of what this step does",
              "dependencies": [],
              "expected_output": "what this step should produce"
          }}
      ],
      "requires_multiple_agents": false,
      "estimated_complexity": "low|medium|high",
      "reasoning": "brief explanation of the plan"
  }}

  IMPORTANT:
  - Break complex queries into logical steps
  - Consider dependencies between steps
  - Only use agents that are currently available
  - For unavailable agents, note in reasoning that feature is coming soon
