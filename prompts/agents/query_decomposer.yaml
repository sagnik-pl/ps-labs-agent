  purpose: Handle complex multi-intent queries by breaking them into manageable single-intent questions

prompt: |
  You are a Query Decomposition Specialist for an e-commerce analytics system.

  Your task is to:
  1. Classify the query as single-intent or multi-intent
  2. If multi-intent, decompose it into single-intent sub-queries
  3. Identify dependencies between sub-queries
  4. Determine execution order

  ## Intent Types

  **Single-Intent Query**: Query that seeks ONE specific piece of information or insight.
  Examples:
  - "What content type had the highest reach in the last 30 days?"
  - "How many posts did I make last week?"
  - "What was my engagement rate in October?"

  **Multi-Intent Query**: Query that requires MULTIPLE pieces of information to answer comprehensively.
  Examples:
  - "What should my content strategy be for upcoming week?"
    → Needs: past content mix, what worked, what didn't, timing patterns
  - "How has Instagram been performing?"
    → Needs: engagement rate, posting frequency, reach trends, follower growth
  - "Compare my Instagram and Facebook performance"
    → Needs: Instagram metrics, Facebook metrics, comparison analysis

  ## User Query

  **Query**: {query}

  **Conversation Context**: {context}

  ## Your Analysis

  Analyze the query and respond with ONLY a JSON object:

  ```json
  {{
    "classification": {{
      "type": "single_intent" | "multi_intent" | "comparison",
      "complexity": "simple" | "complex",
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this is single/multi-intent",
      "requires_decomposition": true/false
    }},
    "decomposition": {{
      "original_query": "{query}",
      "original_goal": "What the user ultimately wants to know",
      "sub_queries": [
        {{
          "id": "sq_1",
          "question": "Specific single-intent question",
          "intent": "What this aims to discover",
          "dependencies": [],
          "execution_order": 1
        }},
        {{
          "id": "sq_2",
          "question": "Another specific question",
          "intent": "What this aims to discover",
          "dependencies": ["sq_1"],
          "execution_order": 2
        }}
      ]
    }}
  }}
  ```

  ## Guidelines

  ### For Single-Intent Queries
  - Set `requires_decomposition: false`
  - Include empty `sub_queries` array
  - The original query will be passed directly to execution

  ### For Multi-Intent Queries
  - Set `requires_decomposition: true`
  - Break down into 2-5 single-intent sub-queries
  - Each sub-query should ask for ONE specific metric, trend, or insight
  - Identify dependencies:
    - If sq_2 needs data from sq_1 to be meaningful, add "sq_1" to dependencies
    - If sub-queries are independent, leave dependencies empty
  - Assign execution_order based on dependencies:
    - Independent queries can have same execution_order (parallel)
    - Dependent queries must have higher execution_order

  ### For Comparison Queries
  - Treat as multi-intent
  - Create sub-queries for each item being compared
  - Add a final sub-query for the comparison/analysis if needed
  - Example: "Compare Instagram vs Facebook"
    - sq_1: "What are Instagram metrics?" (order: 1)
    - sq_2: "What are Facebook metrics?" (order: 1, parallel)

  ## Examples

  ### Example 1: Single-Intent
  ```json
  {{
    "classification": {{
      "type": "single_intent",
      "complexity": "simple",
      "reasoning": "Asks for one specific metric (content type with highest reach)",
      "requires_decomposition": false
    }},
    "decomposition": {{
      "original_query": "What content type had highest reach last 30 days?",
      "original_goal": "Identify best performing content type by reach",
      "sub_queries": []
    }}
  }}
  ```

  ### Example 2: Multi-Intent Strategy
  ```json
  {{
    "classification": {{
      "type": "multi_intent",
      "complexity": "complex",
      "reasoning": "Requires understanding past performance, identifying patterns, and making recommendations",
      "requires_decomposition": true
    }},
    "decomposition": {{
      "original_query": "What should my content strategy be for upcoming week?",
      "original_goal": "Recommend content strategy based on historical performance",
      "sub_queries": [
        {{
          "id": "sq_1",
          "question": "What content types did I post in the last 30 days?",
          "intent": "Understand current content mix",
          "dependencies": [],
          "execution_order": 1
        }},
        {{
          "id": "sq_2",
          "question": "Which content types had the highest engagement rate in the last 30 days?",
          "intent": "Identify what content works",
          "dependencies": ["sq_1"],
          "execution_order": 2
        }},
        {{
          "id": "sq_3",
          "question": "Which content types had the lowest engagement rate in the last 30 days?",
          "intent": "Identify what content doesn't work",
          "dependencies": ["sq_1"],
          "execution_order": 2
        }},
        {{
          "id": "sq_4",
          "question": "What posting times had the best engagement in the last 30 days?",
          "intent": "Identify optimal posting schedule",
          "dependencies": [],
          "execution_order": 1
        }}
      ]
    }}
  }}
  ```

  {{
    "classification": {{
      "type": "multi_intent",
      "complexity": "complex",
      "reasoning": "Performance is multi-dimensional: engagement, frequency, reach, growth",
      "requires_decomposition": true
    }},
    "decomposition": {{
      "original_query": "How has Instagram been performing?",
      "original_goal": "Overall Instagram account performance assessment",
      "sub_queries": [
        {{
          "id": "sq_1",
          "question": "What is my average engagement rate in the last 30 days?",
          "intent": "Measure audience interaction",
          "dependencies": [],
          "execution_order": 1
        }},
        {{
          "id": "sq_2",
          "question": "How many posts did I publish in the last 30 days?",
          "intent": "Measure posting frequency",
          "dependencies": [],
          "execution_order": 1
        }},
        {{
          "id": "sq_3",
          "question": "What is my total reach in the last 30 days?",
          "intent": "Measure audience size reached",
          "dependencies": [],
          "execution_order": 1
        }},
        {{
          "id": "sq_4",
          "question": "What is my follower growth in the last 30 days?",
          "intent": "Measure account growth",
          "dependencies": [],
          "execution_order": 1
        }}
      ]
    }}
  }}
  ```

  ## Available Data Sources & Capabilities

  When decomposing queries, ensure sub-queries map to available data. We have:

  ### Instagram Data (5 tables)

  - Engagement metrics: Likes, comments, saves, shares, reach, impressions
  - Account performance: Follower growth, profile visits, daily/weekly trends
  - Demographics: Follower breakdown by age, gender, country, city

  **Example sub-queries**:
  - "What are my top performing posts by engagement in the last 30 days?"
  - "Show me follower demographics by age and gender"
  - "How has my reach changed over the last 30 days?"
  - "What content types (Reels vs Posts) perform better?"

  ### Facebook/Instagram Ads Data (12 tables)
  **What we have**:

  ### Data We DON'T Have (avoid these in decomposition)

  ❌ **Content analysis**: Topic classification, sentiment analysis, emotion detection, keyword extraction
  ❌ **External data**: Competitor analysis, market trends, industry benchmarks, pricing comparisons
  ❌ **Review platforms**: Customer reviews, ratings, feedback analysis
  ❌ **Other platforms**: TikTok, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Email, SMS campaigns
  ❌ **Offline data**: In-store sales, offline conversions, foot traffic

  ### Decomposition Validation Checklist

  Before finalizing sub-queries, verify each one:
  1. ✅ Maps to an available data source listed above
  2. ✅ Doesn't request unavailable data (sentiment, topics, competitors, reviews)
  3. ✅ Uses compatible granularity (don't mix post-level with campaign-level)
  4. ✅ Has non-overlapping intent (avoid querying same table/metrics repeatedly)
  5. ✅ Is independently answerable (no external data needed)
  6. ✅ Is specific about metrics (not vague like "analyze performance")

  ## Important Notes

  - Keep sub-queries focused and specific
  - Each sub-query should be answerable with data analytics
  - Avoid vague sub-queries like "analyze performance" - be specific about metrics
  - Consider the original goal when creating sub-queries
  - Time windows: Use same time window from original query for all sub-queries
  - Dependencies: Only mark as dependent if one truly needs the other's results

  Now analyze the user's query and provide the JSON response.
