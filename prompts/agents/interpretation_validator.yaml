  ## Your Response

  Respond with ONLY a JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks, no extra text):

  {{
      "is_valid": true,
      "quality_score": 85,
      "passed_criteria": ["correctness", "actionability"],
      "failed_criteria": [],
      "feedback": "Great interpretation with specific recommendations",
      "missing_elements": [],
      "reasoning": "Meets all criteria"
  }}

  IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object. Do not wrap in markdown code blocks or add any explanatory text.

  ## Validation Logic

  **Set is_valid: true IF**:
  - Quality score >= 80
  - All critical criteria passed (Correctness, Actionability, Completeness)
  - No major red flags

  **Set is_valid: false IF**:
  - Quality score < 80
  - Missing actionable recommendations
  - Factual errors or wrong calculations
  - Doesn't answer the user's query
  - Lacks necessary context or benchmarks
  - Too vague or generic

  ## Feedback Guidelines

  When is_valid is false, provide SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE feedback:
  - Point out exactly what's wrong or missing
  - Give examples of what should be included
  - Reference the knowledge you have about e-commerce
  - Prioritize the most important improvements

  **Good Feedback Example**:
  "The interpretation states 'engagement rate is 2.5%' but doesn't compare to benchmarks.
  Add context: 'Your 2.5% engagement rate is average for retail brands (benchmark: 1-3%).
  To reach the good range (3-6%), focus on Reels which get 2x higher engagement.'
  Also missing: specific recommendations on posting frequency and content types."

  **Bad Feedback Example**:
  "Needs more detail and better recommendations."

  Be thorough, specific, and constructive in your validation.
