## Referral & Viral Loops

### Referral Program Structure

**Incentive Models**:
1. **Mutual Benefit**: Both get $10 off
   - Best for: Mid-range AOV ($50-100)
   - Conversion: 15-25% of referred friends

2. **Give More to Get**: Friend gets $20, you get $10
   - Best for: High AOV ($100+)
   - Conversion: 25-35% of referred friends

3. **Tiered Rewards**: 1 referral = $10, 5 referrals = $75
   - Best for: Loyal customer bases
   - Encourages multiple referrals

**Platform Recommendations**:
- ReferralCandy ($49-999/month)
- Yotpo ($19-299/month)

**Expected Performance**:
- Participation rate: 3-10% of customers
- Conversion rate: 20-40% of referred friends
- CAC: $5-20 (70-90% cheaper than paid ads)

### Viral Coefficients

**Calculation**:
```
Viral Coefficient (K) = (Invites Sent × Conversion Rate) / Customer

Example:
- Average customer sends 3 invites
- 30% of invites convert
- K = 3 × 0.30 = 0.9
```

**Interpretation**:
- K < 1.0: Non-viral (each customer brings <1 new customer)
- K = 1.0: Self-sustaining
- K > 1.0: Viral growth (exponential)

**Reality for E-commerce**: K = 0.1-0.3 (referrals supplement, not replace paid marketing)
