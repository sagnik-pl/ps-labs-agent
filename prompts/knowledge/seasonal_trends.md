## Interpretation Guidelines

### When Analyzing Performance

**During Peak Seasons (Q4, BTS)**:
- Expect higher CAC but justify with higher AOV and LTV
- Lower ROAS targets are acceptable (2.0x vs 3.0x baseline)
- Focus on volume and market share capture
- Traffic drops may indicate competitive pressure

**During Slow Seasons (Jan, Jul)**:
- Expect lower conversion rates, higher CAC
- Use for testing new creatives, audiences, products
- Build email list, focus on retention
- Profitability focus over growth

**Month-over-Month Comparisons**:
- Always compare to same month last year (YoY)
- Seasonal fluctuations are normal and expected
- A "bad" January is often just seasonality, not a problem
- Growth in slow months is more impressive than in peak months

### Red Flags (Independent of Season)

- **YoY decline in peak season**: Serious concern, competitive pressure
- **CAC increasing >50% YoY**: Market saturation or creative fatigue
- **Conversion rate decline in slow season**: May indicate underlying UX issues
- **No peak in expected seasonal months**: Category mismatch or poor execution

## Recommendations by Season

### Peak Season Strategy (Q4, BTS)
- Scale ad spend 2-3x baseline
- Launch 2-3 weeks before peak
- Increase inventory 3-4x normal levels
- Add customer service capacity
- Extend return windows
- Offer expedited shipping

### Slow Season Strategy (Jan, Jul)
- Reduce ad spend to profitable ROAS only
- Test new channels, creatives, messaging
- Deep inventory clearance sales
- Focus on email/SMS to existing customers
- Plan and develop for upcoming peak
- Improve conversion rate (CRO projects)
