- Clear path to scaling (CAC trend improving)
- Unique audience (not cannibalizing existing)

**Decision Matrix**:
| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| ROAS >80% of best channel | Scale to 10-15% of budget |
| ROAS 50-80% of best | Continue testing, optimize |
| ROAS <50% of best | Pause, revisit in 6 months |

### Budget Reallocation Strategy

**Weekly Review**:
- Analyze ROAS by channel
- Reallocate 5-10% from underperformers to winners

**Example**:
```
Week 1 Results:
  Meta Ads: $5,000 spend, $15,000 revenue (3.0x ROAS) ← Winner
  Google Ads: $3,000 spend, $7,500 revenue (2.5x ROAS) ← OK
  TikTok Ads: $2,000 spend, $3,000 revenue (1.5x ROAS) ← Underperformer

Week 2 Allocation:
  Meta Ads: Increase to $5,500 (+$500)
  Google Ads: Maintain at $3,000
  TikTok Ads: Decrease to $1,500 (-$500)
```

## Media Mix Modeling

### Attribution Windows

**First-Touch Attribution**:
- Credit: First channel that introduced customer
- Use for: Understanding awareness drivers
- Pro: Shows top-of-funnel value
- Con: Undervalues retargeting

**Last-Touch Attribution**:
- Credit: Last channel before purchase
- Use for: Default in most platforms
- Pro: Simple, direct
- Con: Overvalues bottom-funnel, ignores assists

**Multi-Touch Attribution** (Recommended):
- Credit: Distributed across all touchpoints
- Models: Linear, Time Decay, U-Shaped, W-Shaped
- Use for: Holistic view
- Requires: Attribution tool (Northbeam, Triple Whale)

**Recommended Attribution Window**: 7-day click, 1-day view

### Incrementality Testing

**Concept**: Measure true lift from marketing

**Method**:
1. **Holdout Test**: Exclude 10% of audience from ads for 2 weeks
2. **Compare**: Purchase rate in exposed vs holdout group
3. **Calculate**: True incremental impact

**Example**:
- Exposed group: 2% purchase rate
- Holdout group: 1.5% purchase rate
- Incremental lift: 0.5% (25% of purchases)
- **Insight**: 75% would have purchased anyway (organic/brand)

## Advanced Strategies

### Blended vs Platform ROAS

**Blended ROAS** (Recommended):
```
Blended ROAS = Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend (all channels)
```

**Why Blended**:
- Accounts for multi-touch customer journeys
- Prevents over-crediting last-touch channels
- True business performance indicator

**Platform ROAS vs Blended**:
- Platform ROAS (Meta, Google reports): Often 20-40% higher
- Blended ROAS: True business impact
- Difference: Overlap, view-through attribution

### Lifetime Value Bidding

**Concept**: Bid based on LTV, not just first purchase

**Traditional**: Optimize for 3.0x ROAS on first order
**LTV-Based**: Optimize for 2.0x ROAS knowing LTV is 3x AOV

**Example**:
- AOV: $60
- LTV: $180 (3x)
- CAC Allowance: $60 (1/3 of LTV)
- First-Order ROAS Target: Can drop to 2.0x

**When to Use**:
- Strong repeat purchase rate (>30%)
- Proven LTV data
- Cash flow allows patience

### Portfolio Approach

**Concept**: Balance high-ROAS safe bets with growth investments

**Allocation**:
- **70%**: Proven channels (3.0x+ ROAS)
- **20%**: Scaling channels (2.0-3.0x ROAS)
- **10%**: Testing/Innovation (<2.0x ROAS)

**Benefits**:
- Sustainable growth
- Risk mitigation
- Continuous innovation
