## Working with Jira - Core Principles

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This project works VERY closely with Jira for all task management. When working on this codebase:

1. **Before Starting Work**: Check Jira for current tasks and priorities
2. **During Development**: Update task status (To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done)
3. **When Finding Issues**: Create new Jira tasks immediately
4. **When Seeing Improvements**: Add tasks to Jira backlog with appropriate priority
5. **After Completing Work**: Mark tasks as Done and update TODO.md if needed

### Single Source of Truth

- **Jira** = Task tracking, priorities, sprints, status
- **TODO.md** = High-level implementation notes and current work in progress
- **This Document** = How to work with Jira

## How to Add Tasks to Jira

### Method 1: Via Jira Web UI (Recommended for Quick Tasks)

1. Go to https://photospherelabs.atlassian.net/browse/PSAG
2. Click "Create" button
3. Fill in:
   - **Issue Type**: Task
   - **Summary**: [ID] Brief description (e.g., "[SEC-014] Add API key rotation")
   - **Description**: Problem, solution, acceptance criteria
   - **Epic Link**: Select appropriate EPIC (Security, Architecture, etc.)
   - **Labels**: Add priority (P0/P1/P2/P3) and type (security, bug, etc.)
   - **Assignee**: Sagnik (default)
4. Click "Create"

### Method 2: Via Python Script (For Bulk Tasks)

Use the existing scripts:

```bash
# For single tasks with full descriptions
python create_jira_tasks.py  # Modify TASKS list first

# For bulk simple tasks
python add_remaining_tasks.py  # Add to TASKS list
```

### Method 3: Via Jira REST API (For Automation)

```python
import requests

session = requests.Session()
session.auth = (JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_TOKEN)

payload = {
    "fields": {
        "project": {"key": "PSAG"},
        "issuetype": {"id": "10008"},  # Task
        "summary": "[TASK-ID] Task summary",
        "description": {
            "version": 1,
            "type": "doc",
            "content": [{
                "type": "paragraph",
                "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Task description"}]
            }]
        },
        "labels": ["P2", "bug"],
        "assignee": {"accountId": "712020:0e79e054-9f07-4f7c-91f3-73834452b521"},
        "parent": {"key": "PSAG-4"}  # Epic link
    }
}

response = session.post(
    "https://photospherelabs.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue",
    json=payload
)
```

## Daily Workflow with Jira

### Morning
1. Open Jira board: https://photospherelabs.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PSAG/board
2. Review "In Progress" tasks
3. Check "To Do" for next priority tasks
4. Move task to "In Progress" before starting work

### During Work
1. Update task description with findings/notes
2. Add comments for blockers or questions
3. If you discover new issues ‚Üí Create new Jira task immediately
4. If task scope grows ‚Üí Split into multiple tasks

### End of Day
1. Update task status
2. Add comments on progress
3. Move completed tasks to "Done"
4. Plan next day's tasks

---

## Useful Jira Filters

Create these filters for easier navigation:

```jql
# P0 Critical Tasks
project = PSAG AND labels = P0 AND status != Done

# Current Sprint (P0 + P1)
project = PSAG AND labels IN (P0, P1) AND status != Done

# My In Progress
project = PSAG AND assignee = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress"

# Security Tasks
project = PSAG AND labels = security AND status != Done

# Blocked Tasks
project = PSAG AND status = Blocked
```

---

## When to Create New Tasks

### Bugs Found
1. Create task immediately
2. Add label: `bug`, `P1` or `P2` (depending on severity)
3. Link to appropriate EPIC (usually Quality or Security)
4. Add reproduction steps and error logs

### Improvement Opportunities
1. Create task with label `P2` or `P3`
2. Add description of current state vs desired state
3. Link to appropriate EPIC (Architecture, Tech Debt, etc.)
4. Add to backlog

### Security Issues
1. **CRITICAL**: Create task with `P0` label
2. Add label: `security`
3. Link to Security Hardening EPIC (PSAG-1)
4. Add details: vulnerability, impact, mitigation steps

### Technical Debt
1. Create task with label `tech-debt`, `P2` or `P3`
2. Link to Technical Debt EPIC (PSAG-5)
3. Add description: what's wrong, why it's debt, how to fix

---
