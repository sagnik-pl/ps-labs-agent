## Jira Filters (Create These)

```jql
# P0 Critical Tasks
project = PSAG AND labels = P0

# Current Week
project = PSAG AND labels IN (P0, P1)

# My Tasks
project = PSAG AND assignee = currentUser()

# Security Tasks
project = PSAG AND labels = security

# Blocked Tasks
project = PSAG AND status = Blocked
```

## Sprint Planning Workflow

### 1. **Review Priority Queue**
```
Backlog ‚Üí To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done
  (P3)     (P0-P2)    (1-2 tasks)   (Completed)
```

### 2. **Weekly Planning**
- Monday: Pull P0/P1 tasks from backlog
- Daily: Move 1-2 tasks to "In Progress"
- Friday: Review completed tasks

### 3. **Capacity Planning**
Solo developer: **~40h/week** capacity
- P0 Sprint: 0.5 weeks (20h)
- P1 Sprint: 1.5 weeks (56h)
- P2 Sprints: 8 weeks (310h)
