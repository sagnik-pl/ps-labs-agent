## Next-Gen Kanban Limitations

Next-gen projects have some limitations compared to classic Jira:

1. **No Priority Field**: Used labels (P0, P1, P2, P3) instead
2. **No Story Points**: Using effort estimates in hours
3. **No Issue Links API**: Dependencies documented in descriptions
4. **Limited Custom Fields**: Fewer customization options

---

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Achieved
- 8 EPICs created (including Feature Development)
- 47 initial tasks created (100%)
- All tasks have detailed descriptions
- All tasks linked to EPICs
- All tasks labeled by priority and type
- All tasks assigned to owner

### üéØ Goals
- Complete all P0 tasks within 1 week post-demo
- Achieve 80%+ test coverage
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- All REST/WebSocket endpoints authenticated
